## ‚úÖ **What Is Fully Automated**

### 1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**

* **Azure Environment Setup**:

  * `azure-adfs-keycloak.ps1` provisions the full networking stack, NSG rules, public IP, NIC, and Windows VM.
  * Automates VM creation and provisioning on Azure, including key configurations like NSG rules for RDP/HTTP/HTTPS.

### 2. **ADFS Installation & Bootstrap**

* `adfs/bootstrap.ps1` automatically:

  * Installs Windows features (ADDS, ADFS, etc.)
  * Promotes the server to Domain Controller
  * Generates and installs a self-signed certificate
  * Provisions the ADFS farm

### 3. **SP (Service Provider) Setup**

* `create-sp-apps.ps1`:

  * Automates Azure AD app registrations for OIDC, WS-Fed, and SAML
  * Creates Service Principals
  * Partially configures redirect URIs

* `create-sp-asp.net-testapp.ps1`:

  * Scaffolds **3 ASP.NET Core apps** for each protocol
  * Adds required NuGet packages
  * Writes fully configured `Program.cs` with auth middleware
  * Adds them to a solution and outputs ready-to-run test apps

### 4. **Dockerized Keycloak + ADFS Lab**

* `docker-compose.yml` + `README.md` instructions:

  * Allows `docker-compose up --build` for bringing up Keycloak and (presumably) a Windows container with ADFS.
  * Supports persistent state with volume mounts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Still Requires Manual Steps**

### ‚ùå **Manual Portal Configuration Needed**

* **WS-Fed and SAML** configurations must be completed in the Azure Portal:

  * `create-sp-apps.ps1` outputs reminders: *‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Now go to Azure Portal...‚Äù*
  * This includes setting up reply URLs, identifiers, and claims for:

    * WS-Federation: Federation metadata URL, realm
    * SAML: Entity ID, ACS URL, SSO configuration, attribute mapping

### ‚ùå **Metadata Setup in ADFS**

* Trust setup for Keycloak as a **Claims Provider Trust** in ADFS is manual:

  * You must import Keycloak‚Äôs SAML metadata manually in ADFS Manager
  * Define claims rules manually unless scripted via `Add-AdfsClaimsProviderTrust` (not present here)

### ‚ùå **Host Environment Requirements**

* **Docker must be in Windows container mode**, which isn't always automated-friendly
* Manual setup for `hosts` file (`adfs.contoso.local`, `keycloak.local`)
* ADFS on Windows cannot be containerized cleanly ‚Äî relying on a Windows VM or Hyper-V complicates CI/CD integration

---

## ‚úÖ **Helpful Automation & Developer Utilities**

* `saml_test_sp.html` ‚Äî A lightweight browser-based tool to trigger and test SAML flows manually.
* Uses **JavaScript + pako** to dynamically compress and encode the SAML request.
* Helpful for debugging, but not part of an automated test harness (e.g., no Puppeteer or Cypress integration).

## üîß Recommendations to Reach Full Automation

To consider this environment **fully automated**, you‚Äôd want to:

1. **Script ADFS Trust Setup**:

   * Use `Add-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust` and `Add-AdfsClaimsProviderTrust` via PowerShell to automate all trust relationships.
   * Optionally fetch Keycloak metadata dynamically with `Invoke-WebRequest`.

2. **Automate Azure Portal Steps**:

   * Consider using **Azure CLI**, **ARM templates**, or **Terraform** to configure the SAML and WS-Fed apps end-to-end.

3. **Add Browser-Based Testing**:

   * Integrate **headless testing** (e.g., Selenium, Playwright, Cypress) to simulate SP login ‚Üí ADFS ‚Üí Keycloak ‚Üí back.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**:

   * Wrap this in GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines, or another tool to spin up, test, and tear down the environment.
